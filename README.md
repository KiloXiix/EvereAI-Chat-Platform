# EvereAI-Chat-Platform
A gui interface for chatting with my Ever√©AI model but is compatible with ollama models and can pull them from the internet if needed.

# How To Use
Simply install the exe file and then run it. 
When run, check your windows tray for the app, click it and open the gui.

# Things To Note
Initial response after opening the app always takes between 5-10 minutes as it needs to warm up.
All the following responses are much faster and can take less than a minute depending on your hardware.
The program saves computer resources by unloading the model after 5 minutes of inactivity which will cause the next response after the unloading to take 5-10 minutes again.
